                <!-- Blog Content -->
                <div class="taxi-detail-content">
                    <p class="taxi-detail-lead">In a world still adapting to new health and safety standards, cleanliness has become more than just a matter of comfort—it's a matter of trust. Every time you step into a taxi, you're placing your safety in the hands of someone else.</p>
                    
                    <p>The question is: How clean is your ride? At AV Cars, we've turned that question into a mission. Our commitment to hygiene, sanitization, and passenger well-being has transformed the way we operate. If you're wondering what makes a ride with AV Cars safer and more favourable than the average taxi experience, you're in the right place.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Why Cleanliness in Taxis Matters More Than Ever</h2>
                    <p>Taxis are high-contact environments. Multiple passengers come and go throughout the day. Handles are touched, seats are used, and surfaces accumulate germs. Without proper and frequent cleaning, taxis can quickly become hotspots for bacteria and viruses. This isn't just about avoiding the flu or a common cold—it's about protecting public health in an increasingly interconnected world.</p>
                    
                    <p>Since the COVID-19 pandemic, public awareness of hygiene has skyrocketed. People now expect visible signs of cleanliness. They want reassurance that their transportation provider takes sanitation seriously. At AV Cars, we recognized this shift early and implemented industry-leading cleaning standards that go above and beyond regulatory guidelines.</p>
                    
                    <h2>What AV Cars Does Differently</h2>
                    <p>AV Cars doesn't treat cleanliness as an afterthought—it's part of our core values. Every car in our fleet is subject to a rigorous cleaning schedule that includes both surface-level sanitization and deep cleaning. Our drivers are trained to understand hygiene not just as a task but as a responsibility to our passengers and the community.</p>
                    
                    <p>After each ride, high-touch areas such as door handles, seat belts, window controls, and payment terminals are thoroughly wiped down with hospital-grade disinfectants. At the end of each day, our vehicles undergo a comprehensive cleaning process that includes vacuuming, upholstery sanitation, and interior air purification. These steps are repeated daily to guarantee that every passenger enters a vehicle that feels, smells, and is genuinely clean.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Driver Training and Clean Etiquette</h2>
                    <p>Clean cars start with educated drivers. At AV Cars, all drivers are trained in sanitation best practices. They're taught to clean frequently, monitor their health, and avoid working if they feel unwell. Each driver takes personal protective equipment and maintains cleanliness as a standard part of the customer service experience.</p>
                    
                    <p>What sets our drivers apart is their commitment to making each passenger feel comfortable and secure. You won't find sticky seats, dusty dashboards, or bad smells in an AV Cars taxi. Instead, you'll be welcomed by a driver who takes pride in a tidy environment, with clean windows, fresh air, and a ride that feels more like a private car than a public taxi.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Air Quality Inside the Car</h2>
                    <p>Many people don't realise how important air quality is in a taxi. Enclosed spaces with poor ventilation can quickly become breeding grounds for airborne contaminants. That's why AV Cars has invested in high-quality cabin air filtration systems that keep the air fresh and free of harmful particles. Drivers are instructed to maintain airflow by occasionally cracking windows and using vehicle ventilation to prevent stagnant air buildup.</p>
                    
                    <p>This attention to detail makes a difference. Whether you're commuting to work or taking a late-night ride home, the air you breathe inside an AV car is filtered, circulated, and clean.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Vehicle Inspections and Maintenance</h2>
                    <p>Hygiene and cleanliness are closely linked to proper maintenance. A clean car is often a well-maintained car. At AV Cars, each vehicle undergoes regular inspections not just for mechanical performance but for cleanliness. Our fleet managers guarantee that seats, carpets, dashboards, and even trunks are regularly checked and cleaned. This focus on condition keeps our fleet in top shape and delivers peace of mind to every passenger who rides with us.</p>
                    
                    <p>Cleanliness is not just about aesthetics. A car that's cleaned regularly is less likely to harbour unpleasant surprises, like pests or mould. With AV Cars, you won't have to worry about spills left behind by previous passengers or mysterious stains on the seats.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Customer Comfort and Trust</h2>
                    <p>We believe that passengers should not have to think twice about their safety when they step into a taxi. That's why we make cleanliness visual and reassuring. From the faint scent of a freshly cleaned interior to the smooth feel of a sanitized seatbelt, every detail is designed to help you relax.</p>
                    
                    <p>AV Cars also welcomes customer feedback. If a passenger ever feels a car does not meet our hygiene standards, we take that feedback seriously and act on it instantly. Our reputation depends on trust, and trust begins with clarity and action.</p>
